Description: This package points and scores erroneous taxa in a phylogenetic tree and helps finding artificial errors in GenBank sequences. This package calculate scores for taxa in a tree. Higher score means the taxon is more erroneous. If the score is zero for a taxon, the taxon is not erroneous. This package also can remove all erroneous taxa automatically by iterating score calculation and pruning taxa with the highest score.
